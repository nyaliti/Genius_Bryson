t# Testing Guidelines for Genius Bryson

## Overview
Testing is an essential part of the development process for the Genius Bryson system. This document outlines the testing strategies and procedures to ensure the system functions as intended.

## Testing Strategies
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Unit tests are used to verify the functionality of individual components within the system.
   - Each function or module should have corresponding unit tests to validate its behavior.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Integration tests ensure that different components of the system work together as expected.
   - These tests should cover interactions between the indicator module, analysis engine, and user interface.

3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
   - UAT involves testing the system with real users to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.
   - Feedback from users during this phase is crucial for making improvements.

## Testing Tools
- **MT5 Strategy Tester**: Use the built-in strategy tester in MetaTrader 5 to simulate trading scenarios and evaluate the performance of the Genius Bryson system.
- **Python Testing Frameworks**: If applicable, use frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` for writing and running unit tests.
