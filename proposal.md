## 1. Introduction
The "Genius Bryson" project aims to create an automated assistant for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) that helps forex traders analyze charts effectively. By automating the identification of key patterns and zones, the system will reduce emotional bias in trading decisions.

## 2. Problem Definition
Many traders struggle with emotional decision-making, leading to inconsistent trading results. The lack of a systematic approach to chart analysis can result in missed opportunities and increased risk.

## 3. Objectives
- To develop an MT5 indicator that automates the analysis of forex charts.
- To provide clear insights and predictions based on market patterns.
- To enhance the trading experience by reducing emotional bias.

## 4. Features
### 4.1 Chart Patterns
The system will identify and draw the following chart patterns:
- Flags
- Pennants
- Ascending/Descending Channels
- Parallel/Horizontal Channels
- Ascending Triangle
- Descending Triangle
- Symmetrical Triangle
- Head and Shoulders
- Inverse Head and Shoulders
- Double Top/Bottom
- Triple Top/Bottom
- Rounding Bottom (Saucer Bottom)

- Additional major patterns as identified.

### 4.2 Candlestick Formations
At support/resistance/demand/supply zones, the system will identify:

### 4.4 Insights and Predictions
The system will provide buy/sell insights based on analysis, including suggested stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) levels. It will differentiate between major and minor supply/demand zones and draw order blocks and liquidity concepts.

### 4.5 Customization Options
Users will have the ability to customize colors, parameters, and other settings to suit their preferences.

## 5. System Architecture
The architecture will consist of:
- Data Input: MT5 chart data
- Analysis Engine: Logic for identifying patterns and zones
- Output: Visual representation on the chart with insights

## 6. Development Methodology
The project will follow the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology, including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

## 7. Conclusion
The "Genius Bryson" project aims to empower forex traders by providing a sophisticated yet user-friendly tool for chart analysis. By automating key processes, the system will help traders make informed decisions and reduce emotional bias.
